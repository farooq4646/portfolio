      <h3>AI Text-to-Image Generator</h3>
      <p>Tools & Tech: TensorFlow, Gradio, Stable Diffusion, Python</p>
       <p> I developed a deep learning system that transforms text prompts into realistic images using advanced AI models. Built with TensorFlow and deployed using Gradio, this project allowed users to enter any description and generate a corresponding image in real-time. It was a great hands-on experience with multimodal AI and user-friendly interface design.

      <h3>Personalized Health Recommendation System using Reinforcement Learning</h3>
      <p>Tools & Tech: Python, Q-Network,QQN,PPO, Pandas, Scikit-learn</p>
       <p> This project aimed to simulate an intelligent healthcare assistant that learns and improves its treatment recommendations over time. I used reinforcement learning techniques to train a system that analyzes patient data and adapts its suggestions based on outcomesâ€”just like how a doctor gains experience through feedback. The goal was to explore how AI can personalize healthcare and support better decision-making through continuous learning.</p>
