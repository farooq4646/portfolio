      <h2>From Curiosity to Creation – My Journey into AI</h2>
      <p>When I first started exploring AI, I was both excited and overwhelmed. The idea that machines could learn and make decisions fascinated me, but the technical depth felt intimidating. I decided to start small — building basic models and gradually understanding how algorithms process data, make predictions, and even generate content.</p>
      <p>Over time, what began as curiosity turned into confidence. One of the most exciting moments was seeing my AI Text-to-Image Generator create visuals based on nothing but a text prompt. It felt like bringing imagination to life through code.</p>
      <p>This journey reminded me that persistence is key in tech. Concepts that once felt impossible became part of my toolkit, and I'm excited for what comes next.</p>

      <h2>Can AI Make Healthcare Smarter?</h2>
      <p>Working on my Personalized Health Recommendation System was one of the most meaningful projects I’ve done. It wasn't just about writing code—it was about solving a real-world problem with potential life-saving implications.</p>
      <p>The system used reinforcement learning to simulate a healthcare assistant that adapts its treatment recommendations based on past experiences. It got me thinking: what if AI could support doctors in choosing the best treatment plans for each individual patient?</p>
      <p>This project taught me the importance of ethical AI—how powerful these systems can be, and how carefully they need to be built. It also deepened my appreciation for how technology, when used responsibly, can truly make lives better.</p>
