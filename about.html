      <p>Hi, I’m Mohammad Farooq Yelgodu — a passionate, results-oriented Data and Cloud Engineer with over 3 years of professional experience delivering robust, scalable, and efficient data solutions.</p>
      <p> I specialize in designing, building, and optimizing data workflows that power business intelligence, analytics, and digital transformation. My core technical skills include SQL, Databricks, AWS, Jenkins, Git, and Linux, and I’ve consistently leveraged these technologies to build high-performance ETL pipelines, manage cloud-based infrastructure, and ensure CI/CD automation that supports continuous innovation and delivery.</p>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve worked on a wide range of data engineering challenges — from developing and maintaining production-grade pipelines to managing critical production support tasks for enterprise-level clients like NAB and CITI Bank. I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can collaborate with cross-functional teams to streamline data operations, reduce latency, and enable faster decision-making.</p>
      <p>What drives me is not just solving problems — it’s solving the right problems efficiently and sustainably. I’m deeply invested in automating repetitive tasks, optimizing data flow, and ensuring reliability and uptime in cloud-native systems.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I’m passionate about continuous learning and growth. I regularly explore emerging technologies, take part in certification programs, and collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible with data and cloud infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re looking for a capable engineer to solve complex backend data challenges or a proactive team player who brings value beyond code, I’m always excited to contribute, learn, and lead.</p>
